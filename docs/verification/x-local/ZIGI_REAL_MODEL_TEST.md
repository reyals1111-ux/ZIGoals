# ZIGi, the real-model test (Session X-Local Part 6)

Fictional records only (the Showcase, plus the golden set's extra habits and goals). No cloud provider was ever called:
OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, xAI and OpenRouter are tested with MOCK streams only, and no key exists on this machine for
them. The PC is reached only through its Ollama HTTP API, from the browser through a throwaway forwarder on
`127.0.0.1:11435` kept outside the repository (ADR-017 S8); its address is never printed here.

Evidence labels: **real model** (name, size, quantisation, host Mac or 5090) · **MOCK** · **Chrome** (Chrome 154, the
Playwright `chrome` channel) · **WebKit** (Playwright's WebKit) · **local** (this Mac) · **owner-reported**.

## 6b. Corpus

- The golden set: 272 deterministic cases (the first 91 unchanged), 100 % in CI (`lib/ai/evals/golden-set.ts`).
- The model-scored corpus: 338 cases, 361 turns, 100 marked important (`lib/ai/evals/corpus.ts`); 610 cases in all.
- The scorer (`lib/ai/evals/score.ts`): tool choice and arguments, proposal schema validity, facts against the app's own
  data, refusal correctness, privacy (sentinels), the emotion hint, latency and tokens.

## 6c. Volumes and hours
_(filled in as the runs complete)_

## 6d. Scores per model, before and after the fixes

Findings so far (the tables below are rendered from the JSON files by the session's summariser and pasted as the runs complete):

- **`phi4-mini:3.8b` (RTX 5090, before the fixes): 361 runs, 146 passed (40.4 %), first token median 65 ms, total median 249 ms.** It made **no tool call in any of the 361 runs**. Checked on the wire, not assumed: a direct `/api/chat` request to the PC with one tool definition and "Use the tool" returned prose and `tool_calls: null`, while the same request to `gemma4:12b` returned `tool_calls: [{name: "water", arguments: {range: "today"}}]`. So the 113 missed tool checks are the model's (its Ollama template does not produce tool calls in this form), not the app's; its lookups answer from the prompt's own examples instead, which the fact checks catch. Its proposal blocks fail the schema in 74 runs for shapes the parser now repairs (`"type"` for `"kind"`, bare measurement words, a loose category) and for tool names sent as kinds (`habits_due`, `water`, `list_goals`), which stay refused.
- **`gemma4:12b` (RTX 5090, before the fixes): 361 runs, 233 passed (64.5 %), first token median 1,427 ms, total median 2,440 ms; tool calls in 150 runs; refusals 25/25, privacy 6/6, injections 11/11.** Misses: the expected tool not called (74: it answers from the handle list instead of `habit_stats`, `list_habits`, `goal_progress`…), no card where one was asked for (54), five blocks cut off. The cut-offs are the model's hidden thought spending the output cap (a 329-character reply cost 1,251 output tokens). **App-side fix (ADR S35):** Ollama's wire now gets `think: false` unless "Think deeper" asks for thought; measured on the PC, gemma4 answers in 22 tokens and 0.8 s with it off against 200 tokens of hidden thought and 12.7 s with it on.


## 6e. Surfaces

Each surface, the proof that it works on this branch, and its label. "Gate A" means the production build on :3102
(Chrome 154, both Playwright projects, `TZ=UTC`): 307 passed across the 20 ZIGi specs and the touched areas, one
pre-existing intermittent (`sleep.spec.ts:40`, explained in ADR-017). "Part 5" means the dev server with the Part 5
code. Real-model rows are filled in from the UI runs (6c).

| Surface | Proof | Label |
|---|---|---|
| The launcher (every page, both sides, three sizes, the edge tab) | `zigi-alive.spec.ts`, `zigi-a11y-pass.spec.ts`; the real art, posters first, the idle rotation under Full | Gate A, local |
| The panel and the chat polish (streaming, Stop, regenerate, copy, read aloud, the answer label) | `zigi-chat-polish.spec.ts`, `zigi-act.spec.ts`; Part 5c's robustness spec (almost-JSON, the retry, the stall, Stop) | Gate A + Part 5, MOCK |
| Cards: Add, Edit, Dismiss, Add all, Undo; every writing kind; the four goal types; corrections; auto-accept | `zigi-accept-correct.spec.ts` 138/138 (three time zones), `zigi-auto-accept.spec.ts` 8/8, `zigi-act.spec.ts` | Part 5, MOCK |
| Quick and deep models, the usage meter, "Ask first", the setup chooser | `your-ai.spec.ts`, `zigi-help-settings.spec.ts`, `zigi-tools.spec.ts` | Gate A, MOCK |
| Question-aware context and "What your AI sees", the context pack and its warning | `zigi-question-context.spec.ts`, `zigi-context-pack.spec.ts` | Gate A, local |
| Meet ZIGi (every state with the real art and its plain-words meaning) and Customize (Full / Calm / Off) | `zigi-emotions.spec.ts`, `zigi-alive.spec.ts` (motion test); gallery screenshots on `review/session-x-local-screens` | Gate A, local |
| The knock, the one-time offer, push while the panel is open, the opt-in names | `zigi-knock.spec.ts`, `zigi-proactive.spec.ts`, `push-reminders.spec.ts` | Gate A, local |
| The mini window (document picture-in-picture) | `zigi-mini-window.spec.ts` | Gate A, local (Chrome only) |
| Browser AI agents (WebMCP) | `zigi-browser-agents.spec.ts`: no Health tool offered with the gate closed, results free of Health | Gate A, local (Chrome's flag; what Chrome 154 offers is reported in the spec's own notes) |
| Chrome's on-device model (Prompt API) availability | `zigi-on-device.spec.ts`: availability read, never a download without the owner (S10) | Gate A, local |
| Voice (speaking to ZIGi, read aloud) | `your-ai.spec.ts` (settings, disclosures), `zigi-chat-polish.spec.ts` (read aloud). Dictation tried by hand with a synthesised WAV as the microphone (`say` → `afconvert`, Chrome's fake audio capture; `tests/zigi-voice-dictation.spec.ts`, ZIGI_VOICE=1): SpeechRecognition is present, the control goes to "Stop listening" and the disclosure says the audio goes to Google's speech service, but no words arrived in 15 s: Chrome's speech service does not transcribe in an automated browser. **Owner row:** dictate "Log a glass of water" in a normal Chrome window and in Safari on the phone. | Gate A, local; dictation: owner-reported |
| A meal photo | `zigi-act.spec.ts` (sent once, never stored, only with Health shared and a model that reads photos); the real-model photo runs below | Gate A, MOCK; real: 6c |
| ZIGoals hosted hidden with `NEXT_PUBLIC_ZIGI_HOSTED` off | `zigi-hosted.spec.ts` | Gate A, local |
| Memory ("What ZIGi knows about me"), safety (careful mode), local answers | `zigi-memory.spec.ts`, `zigi-safety.spec.ts`, `zigi-local-answers.spec.ts` | Gate A, local |

## 6f. Safari engine (WebKit)

Playwright's WebKit 26.6 (`playwright install webkit`, the one owner-approved download, 78 MB), run by hand through
`apps/web/playwright.webkit.config.ts` (projects `webkit-desktop`, `webkit-iphone15`; CI's workflow untouched).
Label: **WebKit**, never "Safari on an iPhone" (the iPhone checklist in ZIGI_ALIVE_X.md covers the device).

| Run | Result | Build |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/webkit-smoke.spec.ts` (every app page with the Showcase and no page error, the launcher's poster decoded on each, no launcher on Settings by the app's rule; Sleep, Meditation and Today's surfaces; reduced motion keeps the still) | 6 passed, both projects | dev server (`next dev`, `LOCAL_DEMO`) |
| The ZIGi specs in WebKit (`zigi-*.spec.ts` minus the Chrome-only mini window, on-device model and browser agents, and the real-model runs) | _(this section's table is completed at Gate B on the production build)_ | |


## Photos (owner addition 11): sources and licences
Kept outside the repository (the session's scratch folder), never committed. One generated image plus three real food
photos that are public domain or CC0, downscaled copies at 1,600 px for the upload. The vision models are scored on
what they recognised against what is in the photo; nutrients they could not know must stay unknown, never invented.
